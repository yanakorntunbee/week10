`Syntax`

    function function_name() {  
      //body of the function  
    }   
    To force the execution of the function, we must have to invoke (or call) the function. 
    It is known as function invocation. The syntax for invoking a function is as follows:

    function_name()
    
    `Example`
    
    function hello() //defining a function  
    {  
       console.log ("hello function called");  
    }  
    hello(); //calling of function  
    In the above code, we have defined a function hello(). 
    The pair of parentheses {} define the body of the function, 
    which is called a scope of function.

    `Output`

    hello function called
